## 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine

**[FRACTOT ENGINE] is a fork of godot
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [common tools](https://godotengine.org/features), so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and [consoles](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## Free, open source and community-driven

FRACTOT is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Godot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the [Godot Foundation](https://godot.foundation/)
not-for-profit.
Before being open sourced in February 2014, Godot had been developed by Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur (both still maintaining Godot) for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire titles.

FRACTOT was forked from Godot in OCTOBER 2024
